# esre
Fully configurable JS code formatting.

Why argue in your team or OSS project over code-style? Why have a linter complain at you for some silly style issue?

*esre* code-formatting answers all that. Write your code however you want, run it through esre before linting and before committing, make sure all collaborators have the same esre config, and your worries are just transpiled away like whisps of smoke.
